**sbt-example** is an sbt plug-in for creating unit tests from examples in Scaladoc.

 * [Documentation](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/public/archive/com/thoughtworks/example/sbt-example_2.12_1.0/4.0.3/sbt-example-4.0.3-javadoc.jar/!/com/thoughtworks/Example$.html) - sbt-example eats its own dog food. The tests of sbt-example is generated by sbt-example itself from Scaladoc, which is also the documentation for using sbt-example.

The previous version of this project is the macro annotation [example.scala](https://javadoc.io/page/com.thoughtworks.example/unidoc_2.12/2.0.0/com/thoughtworks/example.html), which is [deprecated](https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta/issues/1182) and does not support Scala 2.12.5+ version.
